# Understanding Physics Visually

Welcome, physics cadet! This is a collection of beginner-friendly **Jupyter notebooks** designed to help you **learn and explore physics concepts through plots and visuals**. Whether you're a student, a self-learner, or just physics-curious — this repo is for you.

> _"Equations explain... but visuals reveal."_

## What’s Inside?

This repository includes notebooks that break down important topics in modern and classical physics using clear, interactive graphs.

### Current Notebooks:
- **Fermi-Dirac Distribution** — Visualize how particles behave at quantum scales
- **Binding Energy per Nucleon** — See what holds a nucleus together
- **Solving Schrödinger Equations** — Quantum wavefunctions and probability
- More coming soon...

## Who is This For?

- **Physics students** (undergrad or high school)
- **Teachers** who want classroom-ready visuals
- **Self-learners** who prefer visual intuition over dry math
- Anyone with a curiosity for the universe!

You don’t need to be a coding wizard. Just follow the setup below and you’re good to go!

## How To Use

### Option 1: Run locally
1. Download or clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Understanding-Physics-Visually.git
    ```
2. Open the folder in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/).
3. Click on any notebook (`.ipynb`) and run the cells to interact with the plots.

### Option 2: Open in your browser (no installation)
- [Try it on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) *(Upload the notebooks manually)*
- Or use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) to preview notebooks without running code
